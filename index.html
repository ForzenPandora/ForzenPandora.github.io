        <h3>Dogs or Cats? </h3>
        <h4>People have been asking this question for a long time, but Tierzoo makes it plan as day in his videos there is
        really only one answer. Dogs</h4>
        <p>Dogs are the best support slash companion build. Cats are neither support or companion, they are simply A tier assassin
        builds.</p>
